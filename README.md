## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project I learned to work with Flexbox and Grid at the same time. It was a bit hard to understand the ways Grid work but after a lot of work I figured it out

### Continued development

Surely going to need more practice with Grid.
